## Phase 1: Feature Implementation

### Component 1.1: Personal Goal Features

##### Task 1.1.1: Add Goal Setting and Tracking
- **Objective**: Implement functionality that allows users to create, view, and track personal productivity goals.
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Files to ADD**:
  - `backend/app/routes/goal_routes.py`: New routes for handling goal-related requests.
  - `backend/app/services/goal_service.py`: New service for managing goal logic (CRUD operations).
  - `backend/app/models/goal.py`: New model definition for persistence of goals.
- **Files to MODIFY**:
  - `backend/app/main_routes.py`: Update to include new routes for goal handling.
  - `backend/config/database_config.template.py`: Ensure database is configured to handle new goal tables.
- **Files to REMOVE**: 
  - None
- **Test Criteria**: Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and track their goals via the app. Ensure all goal-related API responses are correct.
- **Risk Level**: Medium

##### Task 1.1.2: Add Daily Task Prioritization
- **Objective**: Implement a daily task list feature allowing users to prioritize tasks.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1.1 should be completed first (for integration with goals).
- **Files to ADD**:
  - `backend/app/routes/task_routes.py`: New routes for task handling.
  - `backend/app/services/task_service.py`: New service for managing task logic (CRUD operations).
  - `backend/app/models/task.py`: New model definition for persistence of tasks.
- **Files to MODIFY**:
  - `backend/app/main_routes.py`: Update to include new routes for task management.
  - `backend/config/database_config.template.py`: Ensure database schema can accommodate tasks.
- **Files to REMOVE**:
  - None
- **Test Criteria**: Users should be able to create, prioritize, and manage daily tasks seamlessly. Task priorities should be saved and retrievable effectively.
- **Risk Level**: Medium

##### Task 1.1.3: Add Notifications or Alerts
- **Objective**: Implement a notification system for reminders related to goals and tasks.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1.1 and Task 1.1.2 must be completed first (for integration with goals and tasks).
- **Files to ADD**:
  - `backend/app/services/notification_service.py`: New service for managing notifications.
  - `backend/app/routes/notification_routes.py`: New routes for handling notification requests.
- **Files to MODIFY**:
  - `backend/app/models/goal.py`: Update model to include notification settings for goals.
  - `backend/app/models/task.py`: Update model to include notification settings for tasks.
  - `backend/app/main_routes.py`: Update to include routes for notification handling.
- **Files to REMOVE**:
  - None
- **Test Criteria**: Users should receive timely notifications for their goals and tasks as per their settings. All notifications should be logged correctly in the system.
- **Risk Level**: Medium
